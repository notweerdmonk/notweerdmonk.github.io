Worth

For the first light I saw I owe to nine months of her pain,\
to wipe away my tears there she was again,\
not a moment of regret not a word of complain.\
He held my hand taut, made me stand high,\
gave me an identity, made me know who am I.\
All he did proudly never asking why.

Seldom did she know her own womb would give her so much pain,\
Hurt her, scold her, make her cry; again and again.\
Yet not a word in protest nor a word of complain.\
His hopes, dreams and expectations whom were they\
ruthlessly murdered by?\
Reeling under his identity that spineless swine am I,\
Still all he does proudly, never asking why.

To them who are my gods I was so rude and unkind;\
this life I owe to them, its worth I try to find.

Amidst this cunning crowd I did get friends a few,\
but fell for strangers whom I never knew.\
Friends left me and there was nothing I could do.\
With glories too small I boasted a lot,\
belittled I was when it mattered the most,\
numb I became shrouded by a blanket of frost.

With guilt in heart and courage in nerves I set off.\
Mind drowned in dilemma and hollow from within;\
to face the world I stood up,\
swore that until I taste success wouldn’t stop.\
Some warmth I searched for to melt this ice cover,\
at last the one I had always looked upon even didn’t bother.\
Not anybody’s fault, my punishment it was rather.

To them who cared for my rank life I was rude and unkind,\
this life I owe to them, its worth I try to find.
