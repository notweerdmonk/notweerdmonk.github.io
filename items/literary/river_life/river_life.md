# River Life

I, a mere boatman, and I navigate this river\
which with rapids and whirlpools, somewhere deeper or shallower;\
is a simulation of dear life in ways more than one\
and my old trusty raft is a rock hard cushion\
that transmits every undulation on the river.\
Intimidating yet just reactions that my actions trigger,\
like, if I push my raft it pushes me back,\
if I push harder still I will sink into the dark.\
The river has banks that are far from smooth;\
there are rocks in my path that I fear and loathe.\
Then there are ways that split asking for decision\
with the unforeseen beyond the horizon; such a cunning phenomenon.\
As if that was not enough I have the freezing wind\
as a blanket of sorts, numbing my bare skin.\
And also protecting it from further malevolent lashings\
that the river bestows upon during its rough timings.\
But when it is calm it is clear like glass; more of a mirror.\
And looking into it the ubiquitous reflections do appear;\
that it is the time for a mute introspection\
of what I have become and what I have done.\
For sure there are other people going across the river\
but always along the flow, against it never ever.\
Seeing this I think and try to go against,\
but timely I stop because turmoil is what I sense.\
But for sure a strong desire lies deep within\
to rebel against this code; to dare and go upstream.\
And that is just a thought, it better be,\
because there are so many beings here I see;\
which clinging to puny logs pray for dear life\
with other brutal beings in boats huge and vast,\
drowning them with aplomb, mercilessly with haste.\
I am lucky enough to have at least this raft.\
Broken it might be but loyal and apt.\
Because it gives me enough to be able to thrive\
and isn’t monster enough for any godforsaken mischief.\
But still I have done deeds not so noble,\
for which today I toss and tumble.\
This journey of mine I exult and despise;\
I shall but once meet all loved ones before I capsize.\
